# User Experience

A common way to test user experience of a product of app is to use semantic difference scales where adjectives of for example opposite meaning are placed compared. The customer must chose to what degree one of the certain adjectives is more suited. 

## Example
 
[User Experience Questionnaire](https://www.ueq-online.org) is a typical questionnaire used for this purpose.
