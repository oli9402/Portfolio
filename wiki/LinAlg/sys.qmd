Many problem can be formulated as system of linear equations:

## Process optimization 

:::{.callout-note appearance="simple"}
## Example: Chemieproduktion

  - Chemikalien: A,B,C
  - Maschinen: $M_1,M_2$
  - Menge an A,B,C in Tonnen: $x_A,x_B,x_C$
  - Zeitbudget in Stunden: $M_1 = 65, M_2 = 110$
  - Verhältnis in Stunden wie lang werden welche Chemikalien in den Maschinen verarbeitet werden
:::



\begin{pmatrix} 
&|& A&B&C&| &Zeitbudget/h \\

M_1&|&2&1&1&|&65\\

M_2&|&2&3&4&|&110
\end{pmatrix}


### Form linear system of equations


\begin{align*} 
2*x_A + 1*x_B + 1*x_C = 65\\
2*x_A + 3*x_B + 4*x_C = 110

\end{align*}



Looking at the equation we make following observations:

  - we want to find $x_A,x_B,x_C$ that fits the equations as a solution.
  - we add the terms because the individuel maschines can't process the chemicals in parallel so we have to add the time
  - the coefficients of the unknown show a relationship of time per ton
  - $\frac{time}{tone}*time = time$
  - we have three unknown but only 2 equations: 1 free parameter -> infinitive solutions
  - $x_A,x_B,x_C$ can only be positive since you can't produce negative tones.
  
  
### Solving the system

Solving the linear system will end up with a general solution:

\begin{align*}
x_A = \frac{85}{4} + \frac{1}{4}x_C\\
x_B =\frac{45}{2} - \frac{3}{2}x_C \\
\end{align*}


and since the unknown can't be negative we have to see for which range of $x_C$ $x_A$ and $x_B$ are not negative:

\begin{align*}
x_B ≥ 0 \\
\frac{45}{2}-\frac{3}{2}x_C ≥0\\
15≥ x_C\\
\\
0≤x_C≤15
\end{align*}

we can chose any tonne of $x_C$ between 0 and 15.

# Three Types of Echelon Form

1. Pivot element in every row and column.
    - Squared form only possible when $r=c$
    - Last pivot is isolated and can be substituted 
    - **unique solution**
    
2. Pivot in every row but not in every column.
    - more unknown than equations: $r<c$
    - free parameter (the column without pivot)
    - infinitive solutions

3. Rows without pivot.
    - $0=b$
      - if $b \not= 0$ no solution since not consistent
      - if $b = 0$ no information. We can end up with form 1 or 2.
