# Visual inspection

## Residuals vs Fitted 

- Shows whether residuals have non-linear patterns. 
- Equal spread of residual around horizontal line without distinct patters indication of non-linear relationship

## Q-Q Plot

- Shows residuals are normally distributed 

## Scale-Location Plot

- Residuals spread eqaully along the ranges of predictors (homoscedasticity)
- Horizontal line with equally randomly spread points 

## Residuals vs Leverage 

- This plot helps us to find influential cases (i.e., subjects) if there are any.
- We watch out for outlying values at the upper right corner or at the lower right corner. Those spots are the places where cases can be influential against a regression line. Look for cases outside of the dashed lines. When cases are outside of the dashed lines (meaning they have high "Cookâ€™s distance" scores), the cases are influential to the regression results. The regression results will be altered if we exclude those cases.
