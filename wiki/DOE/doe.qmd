# Introduction

Quantitative methods with hypothesis testing are designed around the principles of critical rationalism (Karl Popper). This philosophical position states that *theory can never be finally verified but only falsified.*

Descriptive statistics can only describe the sample as a subset of the population. 
Inferential statistics draws conclusions about the population based on the sample.

## Observational 

*Descriptive* character, suitable for *forming hypotheses* (but not optimal for testing a hypothesis)

### Cross Sectional Study (e.g. Survey)

- no group comparison
- e.g. "Quality of Life of Master Students"

### Correlational Study 

- no group comparison
- e.g. "Time spent on self-study and general quality of life correlate."

### Analytical study 

- group comparison
- Identification and quantification of effects / verification of relationships
- *Not* fully suitable for hypothesis testing 

#### Example: Cohort Study

Multiple cohorts (group of people with comparable inital conditions) are observed. One cohort is exposed to certain factors. Cohorts are compared after 

- Smoking and Alzheimers

#### Case Control Study 

- Retrospective comparing cases with controls (self-reports?)

## Other Forms 

- Cross-over design: during study treatment and control switches
  - used in randomized and non-ramdomized (quasi)
- Before / After comparison
- Longitudinal studies: 
  - Trend study: different times with diff. samples
  - Panel study: different times with same sample
  
# Variance as basic concept

- Primary variance:
  - Impact of (experimental) factors on the change / variantion of the output
  
- Secondary variance: 
  - Variation of output caused by nuisance variables

- Error variance: 
  - caused by measurement errors and random processes

# Experimental Design
Example: determine which variables have an influence on petrol consumption. 

## One-Factor-at-a-time (OFAT)

## Full factorial designs

## Fractional factorial designs

# Quality criteria of experiments

## Internal Validity

- is *essential condition* for external validity.
- Changes in dependent variable clearly attributable to changes in independent variables.
- Increases with decreasing impact of nuisance variables (Quasi-Exp -> Experiment).

## External validity 

- Results of experiment can be generalized to population
- increases with increasing naturalness (laboratory -> field)
- high internal validity can be problematic for external validity (labor vs. field)

#### Population validity

- selection of representative sample

#### Situation validity 

- generalizable to situations deviating from experiment (ecological validity)

#### Construct validity 

- adequate operationalization of latent variable (construct)
