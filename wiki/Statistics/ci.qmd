## What are Confidence Intervals (CI)

## Interpretation of CI

CI are notoriously being misinterpreted. Altough in my opinion these interpretation are not too harmful but rather ignore some uncertainty that still exists after calculating CI's. Once again in statistics it's a good idea to not fully really on one criteria for making a test decision. Furthermore, this shows that at the end of every analysis there must be a human that makes the final decision. I would argue that statistical inference is about reduction of uncertainty in light of a decision rather than fully eliminating uncertainty and making a decision itself (this task must be made by a human). 



## Simulation 

This can be [simulated](../../posts/confidence_intervals/index.qmd) using R.
